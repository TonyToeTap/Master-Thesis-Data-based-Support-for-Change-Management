#Summary
This project was part of my master thesis. The goal was to support the change management with a tool. The tool should enable the change management to learn from the past and to develop a higher understanding for the changes in the company. For this purpose, different key figures should be determined and visualized. In addition, the tool should directly support the user in the interpretation of the key performance indicators. The overall goal was to enable change management to make data based decisions and thus to make activities such as analysis and planning of changes more effective.

The tool was developed in cooperation with a medical technology company. The data for determining the various key figures was provided by the change management department. With the help of a workflow management system, the data of changes of the last 2 years were documented. Additional useful data and information, such as the target process and the target times of the process activities, were also provided. 

At the end of the project, the tool was evaluated together with the company's change management department. 
In the long term, it is planned to integrate the developed tool into already developed tools in order to provide the company with holistic support.
